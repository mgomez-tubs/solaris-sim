<h2>Information</h2>
Mercury is the innermost Planet of the Sol-System and one of four "terrestial planets", meaning it is composed mainly of solid material. It is also the smallest Planer comparable in size to the moons Ganymede or Titan but more massive than
these. Being the innermost planet means that Mercury is the closest one to all the other planets for the longest amount
of time.
<h2>Exploration</h2>
Currently there are three missions to mercury two of them past and one ongoing. The two NASA probes Mariner 10 launched
in 1973 and MESSENGER launched in 2004 discovered a magnetic field and Mapped the whole surface of Mercury. The Ongoing
BepiColombo mission by the ESA and JAXA, launched in 2018, is designed to explore the physical properties of the planets
as well as properties of the magnetic field.
